# Basics of Open Loop Optimization of LTI Systems

Read the *"Open Loop Optimization of LTI systems.pdf"* document to get an overview of the full and reduced batch approaches to dynamic optimization of LTI systems.
Then download the example script and play around with it!

If you find any errors, let me know 🙂 (I have not tested this extensively)
If you have any questions, or would like me to add something, please contact me. Either by mail: tagabrie@ntnu.no, or by some other means.

The example script uses the functions found in the "MATLAB Functions" folder, but they are also included directly in the script.

#### Do NOT use the functions from the "MATLAB Functions" folder for MPC purposes if they have to be used on-line!! They are written to be easy to understand for beginners, and not to be fast.
